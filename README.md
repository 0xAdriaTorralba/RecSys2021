In this folder you will find:

**PFM.pdf**, where we summarise oand explain our work. 

**Mixed_Model.ipynb**, a notebook with all the code necessary to load, train and test the final Mixed Model (NRT) and (RT), along with code used to perform feature importance plots.

**Text_Based_Model.ipynb**, a notebook with all the needed code to load, train and evaluate the final Text Model. In addition to this, it provides the needed code to show the feature importance of the models and save and load trained models.

**Non_Text_Based_Model.ipynb**, a notebook with all the code necessary to load, train and test the final Non-Text Based Model, along with code used to perform feature importance plots. It can be run sequentally or starting at either Train or Test sections.

**DataExploration/** a folder containing **data_exploration.ipynb** and **data_exploration_validation.ipynb**, notebooks containing the code used to perform some exploration of the subsampling and the validation data that we used to train our models.
